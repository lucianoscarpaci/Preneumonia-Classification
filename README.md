# Preneumonia-Classification
EfficientNet-Based Deep Learning Model for Early Preneumonia Detection. This project uses Pytorch and EfficientNet to perform classification on X-ray images whether it is Preneumonia or Normal. On some of the results you can see that it had low test accuracy but it had high training accuracy and it really did detect the presence of Preneumonia.

# Preneumonia-Classification

EfficientNet-Based Deep Learning Model for Early Preneumonia Detection

## Overview
This project leverages PyTorch and EfficientNet to classify X-ray images as either Preneumonia or Normal. The model aims to assist in the early detection of preneumonia by analyzing medical imaging data.

## Features
- Utilizes EfficientNet for robust image classification
- Implements PyTorch for model training and evaluation
- Detects the presence of preneumonia with high training accuracy

## Results
While the model demonstrates high training accuracy, it exhibits lower test accuracy. This indicates potential overfitting, but it successfully detects the presence of preneumonia in the training data.

## Installation
To get started, clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

In Docker and JupyterLab

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lucianoscarpaci/Preneumonia-Classification.git
